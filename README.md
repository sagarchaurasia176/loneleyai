# 🎙️ Lonely AI Real-Time Conversation Platform
# Currently Working

## 📌 Overview

This project is an **AI-powered real-time conversation platform** where users can **talk directly to an AI using voice**. The UI is inspired by **Google Meet**, and users can choose different **AI characters/avatars** to interact with. The AI listens, understands, and responds **in real time**, with responses also shown in a **structured table format**.

This platform is ideal for:

* Mock interviews
* Communication practice
* AI-assisted conversations
* Learning & feedback sessions

## ✨ Key Features

* 🗣️ **Real-Time AI Voice Conversation**

  * Users speak directly to the AI
  * AI listens and responds instantly

* 🎭 **Character-Based AI Interaction**

  * Users can choose different AI characters
  * Each character can have a unique tone or personality

* 📊 **Structured Table Responses**

  * AI responses are also displayed in a clean table format
  * Useful for clarity, feedback, and analysis

* 🎥 **Google Meet–Like UI**

  * Video-call inspired interface
  * Clean, modern, and familiar design

* 🔁 **Live Response Flow**

  * Voice → AI Processing → Voice + Table Output

## 🧠 How It Works (High-Level Flow)

1. User speaks through the microphone
2. Voice input is captured in real time
3. AI processes the speech
4. AI generates a response
5. Response is:

   * Played back as voice
   * Displayed in a table format on the UI
